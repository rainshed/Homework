# computational physics exercise 1


## store

the output data is stored under './data/'
the output picture is stored under './picture/'
the plot scipt is stored uder './plot/'
the module used in program is stored under './module/'


## output

--------------------------------------------------------------------
energy value is printed on screen, wave function is plot by gnuplot
--------------------------------------------------------------------

execute 'make p1 ', output energy value and wave function of problem 1
execute 'make p3n', output energy value and wave function of problem 3 by numerov method
execute 'make p3d', output energy value and wave function of problem 3 by diagonalization method
execute 'make p4n', output energy value and wave function of problem 4 by numerov method
execute 'make p4d', output energy value and wave function of problem 4 by diagonalization method
